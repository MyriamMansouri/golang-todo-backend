## Developping

```bash
npm run main.go
```
## This repo was created to tinker with:

- Go
- REST API

## Next Steps:

- Set up a better file structure (eg. https://tharindubalasooriya.medium.com/building-and-deploying-restful-api-with-go-970016d3f841)
- Connect this to a database (Turso?)
- Deploy (fly.io?)
